============

A small example showing how Max and Processing can talk to each other.

Prerequesites
============

* Max/MSP, or at least the Max runtime (http://cycling74.com/products/max/)
* Processing (https://processing.org/download/)
* The OSC External Objects from CNMAT (http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/downloads)
* The oscP5 Processing library (http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/)

How to run?
===========

* Open the .maxpat in Max, follow instructions to use it
* Open the .pde file in Processing
* Run the Processing file; it should respond to actions in Max!
